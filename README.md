# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Energy-Consumption
## Problem Statement
This project has been done in fulfillment to the Capstone Project requirement of Entri Elevate's Data Science and Machine Learning Program.

This project aims to develop a time series forecasting model for predicting energy consumption patterns in smart grid systems. By leveraging historical data on energy usage, weather conditions, holidays, and other relevant factors, the model seeks to forecast future energy consumption accurately. The goal is to optimize energy distribution and resource allocation, enabling efficient management of electricity grids. By forecasting energy consumption patterns, this project contributes to reducing costs, improving grid reliability, and promoting sustainability in energy management.
